# Deeper and Mixed Supervision for Salient Object Detection in Automatic Suface Inspection
This repository provides saliency maps of DMS network in Magnetic-tile-defect-datasets(MTDD), RSDDs, Road Cracks dataset and NEU surface defect dataset.
## ASI Datesets
If you need those ASI datasets, you can reach as follows:  
>MTDD: *<https://github.com/abin24/Magnetic-tile-defect-datasets.>*  
>RSDDs: *<http://icn.bjtu.edu.cn/Visint/resources/RSDDs.aspx>*  
>RoadCracks: *<https://github.com/cuilimeng/CrackForest-dataset>*  
>NEU surface defect datasets: *<http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/me/songkc/Vision-based_SIS_Steel.html>*  
## Evaluation of the results
You may refer to this repo for results evaluation: [SalMetric.](https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/SalMetric)
## Comparision with 6 SOTA SOD Methods
We also make the comparision with 6 state-of-the-art SOD methods. You can find saliency maps of those methods in `./SM/`. Those saliency maps were generated by running the open source code provided by authors:
